# bbanks_assembly_fizzbuzz

This is Fizzbuzz written in Assembly. I just did this for fun and for some assembly practice.

> The Fizzbuzz test
>
> - Print the numbers 1-100
> - If the number is a multiple of 3 print "Fizz", instead of the number
> - If the number is a multiple of 5 print "Buzz", instead of the number
> - For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print “FizzBuzz”

Solving the problem in Assembly made me really focus on the logic of the problem.

Concepts used in this project:

- MIPS Assembly Language
